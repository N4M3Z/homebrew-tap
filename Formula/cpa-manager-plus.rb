# Upstream ships prebuilt release binaries only; this formula pins the
# darwin/arm64 tarball by SHA-256. The binary resolves its data directory
# relative to argv[0] without resolving symlinks, so the real executable
# lives in libexec and bin carries a wrapper that invokes it through a
# symlink inside CPAMP_HOME.
