# Tracks every upstream release instead of homebrew-core, whose livecheck is
# throttled to every fifth tag. Installs the prebuilt release archive pinned by
# the SHA-256 that upstream publishes in checksums.txt; there is no signature
# or build attestation upstream, so the source tarball would carry the same
# trust. The prebuilt binary defaults to ./config.yaml, so the service passes
# -config explicitly and the config lives at the same path homebrew-core used.
