# Tracks every upstream release instead of homebrew-core, whose livecheck is
# throttled to every fifth tag. Installs the prebuilt release archive pinned by
# the SHA-256 that upstream publishes in checksums.txt; there is no signature
# or build attestation upstream, so the source tarball would carry the same
# trust. The prebuilt binary defaults to ./config.yaml, so the service passes
# -config explicitly and the config lives at the same path homebrew-core used.

  # Upstream also publishes Linux archives, but the Linux lane uses upstream's
  # own installer with systemd, so this formula stays macOS-only. Brew parses
  # the formula on Linux too, so a macOS archive is selected on every host
  # and the macOS dependency below blocks a Linux install. A top-level url
  # with an on_intel override fails brew audit, which reads the override as
  # a second stable url.
